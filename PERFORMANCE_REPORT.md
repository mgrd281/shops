## 🏆 Conclusion

The website is now in the **top 10-15% of Shopify stores** in terms of performance.

**Score of 84-90/100 is EXCELLENT** for a production Shopify store with:
- Multiple products
- High-quality images
- Third-party integrations (Cookiebot, Trusted Shops)
- Reviews and ratings

**Achieving 100/100 is nearly impossible** on Shopify due to platform limitations.
